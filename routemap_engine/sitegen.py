"""
Regenerate routemap/engine/data/site_codes.tsv from each carrier's own published
router list.

Run it when a carrier publishes new sites:

    python -m routemap.engine.sitegen            # fetch live, rewrite the TSV
    python -m routemap.engine.sitegen --dry-run  # print what would change
    python -m routemap.engine.sitegen --out FILE # write somewhere else

WHY A GENERATOR AND NOT A HAND-MAINTAINED LIST
----------------------------------------------
Every row in the table is a claim about where somebody else's router is. A
hand-maintained list of those claims decays silently and cannot be audited: you
cannot tell, a year later, which rows came from the operator and which came
from somebody's recollection. So the table is generated from the operator's own
published mapping, each row records which source it came from, and this script
is how you re-derive it.

City coordinates come from the bundled GeoNames table (routemap/engine/data/
cities.tsv, CC BY 4.0) rather than from anywhere new, so there is one source of
coordinates in the feature and the licence position does not change.

ADDING A CARRIER
----------------
See routemap/engine/data/README.md. In short: add an entry to CARRIERS below whose
`fetch` returns {router_name: "City (facility)"}, confirm every city resolves,
and re-run. A carrier whose published list you cannot reach is a carrier that
does not go in the table.
