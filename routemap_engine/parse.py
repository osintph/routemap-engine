"""
Traceroute output parsers for the Route Map tab (v3.35.0).

WHAT THIS PARSES
----------------
Four real-world shapes, auto-detected, because an investigator pastes whatever
their own machine produced:

  Windows tracert          RTTs first, then "name [ip]" or a bare address,
                           "Request timed out." for a dead hop, "<1 ms" for
                           sub-millisecond.
  Windows tracert -d       the same, with no name column.
  Unix traceroute          address first ("name (ip)" or, with -n, a bare
                           address), then one RTT per probe, "*" for a lost
                           probe, and "!H"-style unreachable codes. A hop that
                           answered from more than one address continues on
                           indented lines with no hop number, which is the
                           normal shape of an ECMP hop and not an anomaly.
  mtr --report / -w        "N.|-- host  Loss%  Snt  Last  Avg  Best  Wrst StDev",
                           "???" for a hop that never answered.

DETECTION, AND WHY IT IS A SCORE AND NOT A SNIFF
------------------------------------------------
The header lines ("Tracing route to", "traceroute to", "HOST:") are the obvious
signal and are used, but they are also the first thing a paste loses: people
select from the first hop down, or the tool is wrapped by a script that prints
its own banner. So each parser runs over the whole text, reports how many hop
lines it recognised, and the winner is the one that recognised the most. A
header match only breaks a tie.

The one genuine ambiguity is tracert versus traceroute, because
"1  1 ms  1 ms  1 ms  192.168.1.1" is a valid-looking body for both readings.
It is resolved structurally rather than by guessing: a traceroute hop body
always *begins* with an address, so :func:`_parse_traceroute` refuses a body
whose first token is a timing. That is a property of the format, not a
heuristic about this input.

WHAT A PARSER DOES NOT DO
-------------------------
No geolocation, no judgement, no network access: a Hop is what the text said,
including hops that answered from several addresses and hops that answered not
at all. Everything downstream (routemap/engine/geo.py) reads Hop and never the
raw text, so adding a fifth format means adding a parser here and nothing else.
