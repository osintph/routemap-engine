"""
Per-hop geolocation, the RTT physics bound, and the hop annotations.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
-----------------------
Drawing a traceroute on a map by feeding each hop to an IP geolocation
database produces a path that crosses oceans it did not cross. The reason is
not that the databases are bad; it is that a backbone router's address is
registered wherever its operator filed the prefix. A Tata router in the middle
of a Manila-to-California path geolocates to whatever country Tata registered
that block in, and the map then shows the packet detouring through it.

Two defences, in this order:

1. Ask the router's hostname first (``routemap/engine/hoiho.py``, then the
   carrier site-code table in ``routemap/engine/sitecodes.py``). The carrier's
   own naming scheme is better evidence than a registry entry.
2. Check every candidate location against the speed of light. A location that
   cannot be reached and returned from inside the measured RTT is wrong, no
   matter which source said it, so it is rejected and the next source is tried.

THE BOUND
---------
Light in fibre travels about 200 km per millisecond (c times a refractive index
of roughly 1.47, so about 204 km/ms; 200 is the round number everybody uses).
An RTT is a round trip, so the distance a hop can be away is at most

    max_km = min_rtt_ms * 200 / 2 = min_rtt_ms * 100

:data:`KM_PER_MS_ROUND_TRIP` is that 100.

Three properties of this bound matter, and getting any of them wrong turns a
sanity check into a source of false rejections:

* It is an **upper** limit only. Real paths are longer than the great circle,
  routers add processing delay, and queueing and asymmetric return paths inflate
  RTTs routinely. A hop whose RTT is far larger than the distance needs is
  normal and is never rejected for it. Only the impossible direction is checked.
* It is measured against the **minimum** RTT of the hop's probes, because the
  floor of several samples is the closest thing to propagation delay. Using the
  average would reject real locations on a congested path.
* It is applied with a tolerance (:data:`SLACK_KM`), because the origin itself
  is only known to city level and the first hop of a trace legitimately reports
  0.0 ms. Without it, a 0.2 ms LAN hop would "prove" that every location on
  earth is impossible.

ANNOTATIONS
-----------
The three things an investigator reading a trace has to know not to
misinterpret, each stated rather than left as a surprising number:

* An RTT that falls at the *next* hop means the inflated hop's reply took a
  different way back, not that the packet went somewhere and came back. Labelled
  as an asymmetric return path, and the hop is not moved on the map.
* Loss at a middle hop with no loss after it is the router rate-limiting its own
  ICMP replies, not packets being dropped. It is the single most common
  misreading of a traceroute.
* A tail of hops that never answer is the destination or its firewall declining
  ICMP, which is not a broken path.

SOURCES ARE PASSED IN
---------------------
The three network sources (PTR, Hoiho, the IP database) arrive as a
:class:`Sources` value, so the engine holds no configuration of its own. The
desktop app builds one from its settings with :func:`default_sources`;
FalconEye builds one from its server config and its own database-backed cache.
The carrier site-code table is offline and always consulted.
