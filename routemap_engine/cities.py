"""
The bundled offline city list, for the Route Map origin picker.

WHAT IT IS AND WHERE IT CAME FROM
---------------------------------
``routemap/engine/data/cities.tsv`` is GeoNames' ``cities15000`` dump (every
populated place above 15,000 people, 34,152 rows), trimmed to the seven columns
this feature uses and with the coordinates rounded to two decimal places.

cannot be lost by touching only one of them: the header of the data file, the
data-sources strip in the page footer, and the Acknowledgments section of the
README.

WHY IT IS BUNDLED AND NOT A SERVICE
-----------------------------------
The thing being resolved is the visitor's own location. Typing "Manila" into a
geocoding API to find out where Manila is would mean telling a third party where
the visitor is, to answer a question that has a fixed answer. A file in the
repository answers it with no request leaving the box.

MEMORY, AND WHY THE LOAD IS LAZY
--------------------------------
Parsed, the table is roughly 9 MB of Python objects per worker, which on a
1 GB box with three workers is not free. It is therefore loaded on the first
search and not at import: a worker that never serves the origin picker never
pays for it, which on an instance where nobody opens the Route Map tab is every
worker. :func:`loaded` exists so a test can assert that property rather than
trust this comment.

    the city is a convenience and the coordinates are the actual origin.

    Not simply the closest city. GeoNames' cities15000 contains city districts
    as rows of their own, so the nearest row to central Manila is Paco and the
    nearest to central Hannover is Nordstadt: both correct, both useless as a
    label for where somebody is. The pick is therefore the most *significant*
    nearby place, scoring population against distance:

    (2.9M, 8 km), and is the answer a person would give.

    as coordinates rather than attached to the nearest populated place 900 km

    origin, so there is no index to keep correct.
