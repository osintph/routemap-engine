"""
Carrier site codes: the third geolocation source, offline and carrier-specific.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
CAIDA Hoiho is the right first source, but its ruleset does not cover every
carrier. Measured on 2026-10-03 against ruleset 2024-08, it matched 0 of 5
Arelion/Twelve99 backbone hostnames, and the IP database is actively wrong for
exactly those routers: RIPEstat/MaxMind places 62.115.209.158, a router Arelion
itself names ``hnk-b4`` (Hong Kong), in Paris, and returns 0,0 for the
Singapore and Frankfurt ones. So on a Manila-to-Europe path, the two approved
sources between them could not place the Hong Kong, Singapore or Marseille
legs at all.

The information needed to place them is sitting in the hostname, published by
the carrier: Arelion's own looking glass says ``hnk-b4`` is "Hong Kong
(MEGA-i)". This module is that mapping, applied only to the carrier that
published it.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
----------------
It is not generic three-letter-code guessing. A hostname containing "sin" or
"lax" anywhere is not evidence of anything: ``lax`` appears in "relaxed" and
customer hostnames routinely contain city-ish fragments that mean nothing. So:

* a pattern applies only to hostnames under that carrier's own backbone
  namespace, and
* customer-facing namespaces are excluded, because a customer interconnect is
  named after the customer and not after the site. ``plusline-ic-323934.ip.
  twelve99-cust.net`` must not be read as a site code, and is not, because
  ``ip.twelve99-cust.net`` is excluded.
* a code that the carrier uses for two different cities is dropped at build
  time rather than guessed at (see ``ewr`` in routemap/engine/sitegen.py).

Every row records which published source it came from. See
routemap/engine/data/README.md for how to add a carrier.

ORDER AND THE PHYSICS BOUND
---------------------------
Hoiho first, then this, then the IP database. A site-code location is a claim
like any other and goes through the same RTT check in routemap/engine/geo.py: if
the hostname says Hong Kong but the round trip cannot reach Hong Kong, the hop
is not placed in Hong Kong.
