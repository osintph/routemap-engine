"""The traceroute parsers: one trace, three tools, the same hops.

A paste comes from whatever the investigator's machine produced, so the parser
is the one place a format difference is allowed to exist. Everything
downstream reads Hop objects, which is why these tests compare the three
formats against each other rather than each against a hand-written expectation:
if tracert and traceroute of the same path disagree about which addresses were
seen, one of the parsers is wrong, and asserting them separately would hide it.

Fixtures are two real paths from a Manila origin (see
tests/fixtures/routemap/), rendered in all three formats.
